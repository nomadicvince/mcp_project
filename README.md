# Model Context Protocol

> **A sovereign, lightweight protocol for memory-first, agent-based AI systems.**  
> Designed for precision, permanence, and purpose.

---

## 🔭 Overview

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an experimental AI orchestration framework that centers context, not chains. It’s a modular system where agents operate through a shared `ContextObject`, allowing intelligent decision-making, memory-aware behavior, and structured autonomy.

This project is not a chatbot framework. It is a **protocol**—one that asks:  
> _"What if memory, intention, and logic were built into the heart of our systems?"_

## 🧠 Core Concepts

- **ContextObject** – the persistent container of memory, preferences, and goals
- **Orchestrator** – routes input through validation, agent selection, and tool access
- **Agent Modules** – each agent operates independently, can read/write context
- **PolicyEngine** – governs access control, safety, and agent authorization
- **Tools** *(planned)* – callable external modules: APIs, embeddings, DBs

## ⚙️ Quick Start (Fedora / Linux)

```bash
# Clone and set up
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcp-project.git
cd mcp-project
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run it
python run_server.py
```

You’ll see:

## 🌌 Why This Matters

MCP is about **sovereign design**.  
It lets developers build intelligent agents that **think in context**, **act independently**, and **remember**.

> This is for anyone building not just apps—but systems that last.

---

## 🚀 Roadmap

- [ ] Add multi-agent dynamic routing
- [ ] Implement persistent memory layer (SQLite / Redis)
- [ ] Extend policy engine with scoped permissions
- [ ] Define tool interface (API calls, embeddings, search)
- [ ] FastAPI or WebSocket bridge (optional server mode)
- [ ] Internal DSL for agent-to-agent communication

## 🜂 Optional: Planetary Protocol Seal

If included, the seal at the top represents the **foundational contract** of this protocol—its energy, ancestry, and intent.  
It is not branding. It is **a boundary sigil**.
